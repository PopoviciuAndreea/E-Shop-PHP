# E-Shop-PHP
Electronics store created in HTML and CSS with a PHP back-end

I have created for my PHP exam an online shop of electronic products using PHP, HTML and CSS with a MySQL database. 
The website contains an authentication mechanism that uses sessions, all users can add, delete or view the products in the shopping cart and the administrator can perform CRUD operations for products within the store and for registered customers. The shop allows the user to view the site translated into two languages, Romanian or English and the code contains two automations using WebDriver and a Selenium server.
