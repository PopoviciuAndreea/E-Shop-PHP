# E-Shop-PHP
Electronics store created in HTML and CSS with a PHP back-end

I have created for my PHP exam an online shop of electronic products using PHP, HTML and CSS with a MySQL database. 
The website contains an authentication mechanism that uses sessions, all users can add, delete or view the products in the shopping cart and the administrator can perform CRUD operations for products within the store and for registered customers. Moreover, the application supports translations in both Romanian and English languages. Additionally, the code includes two automations using WebDriver and a Selenium server.
